/*
 * CMSC 12300 - Computer Science with Applications 3
 * Borja Sotomayor, 2013 (original code)
 * Matthew Wachs, 2016 (port to C)
 *
 * An implementation of the thread pool pattern.
 *
 * A thread pool is created with a fixed number of threads
 * and a queue with a size limit. Initially, the queue
 * will be empty and the threads will be idle (waiting
 * for tasks to arrive). While waiting, they should not
 * busy-wait; they should sleep until the queue becomes
 * non-empty.
 *
 * As tasks arrive, they are placed on the queue, and
 * claimed by the next idle thread.
 *
 * If all the threads are busy, this just means the task
 * will have to wait in the queue until it is run. However.
 * if the queue reaches its limit, any new tasks will be
 * rejected.
